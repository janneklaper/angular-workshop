  <h2>Whisky</h2>
  <p>
    Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented
    grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties,
    including barley, corn (maize), rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks,
    generally made of charred white oak. Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types.
    The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the
    fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels.

    The word whisky (or whiskey) is an anglicisation of the Classical Gaelic word
    uisce (or uisge) meaning "water" (now written as uisce in Irish Gaelic,
    and uisge in Scottish Gaelic). Distilled alcohol was known in Latin as aqua vitae
    ("water of life"). This was translated to Classical Gaelic as Irish: uisce beatha/Scottish Gaelic:
    uisge beatha "water of life". Early forms of the word in English included uskebeaghe
    (1581), usquebaugh (1610), usquebath (1621), and usquebae (1715).
